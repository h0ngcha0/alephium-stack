`liuhongchao/explorer:latest` image is built using the following
command under the [explorer](https://github.com/alephium/explorer/)
project.

```
export REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://alephium.hongchao.me/
./build-docker-image.sh

You might wanna replace the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` with your own
domain name.
